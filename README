This is the standard petclinic sample app provided with SpringFramework 2.5.6 in use for testing at NewRelic.

You will need a mysql database called petclinic and a user 'pc' with password 'pc' and full privileges on that DB.

The mysql-dump directory has a tarball of the standard data set used in internal testing.
